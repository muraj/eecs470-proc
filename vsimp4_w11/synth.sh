# This script is for the purpose of submitting a synthesis job to the cluster.
# The script will copy project files to the home space (if needed), and then
# submit a job to the batch system.

# Usage: ./synth.sh [-s | -a]
# -s: Check out copy of SVN repository specified by SVN_REPO
# -a: Copy files from AFS space specified by AFS_DIR

# If the -s or -a flag is used, then the script will either check out files
# from an SVN repository (located in your AFS space) or just copy files from
# your AFS into WORK_DIR.  Otherwise the script will use the files that
# exist in WORK_DIR.

# Modify these variables with your information
# SVN_REPO: Location of your SVN repository
# AFS_DIR: Location of files in AFS space if not using SVN
# WORK_DIR: The name of the folder in which the files are located locally
# EMAIL: Your e-mail address, the batch system will e-mail updates to you
# ROOT_PROJ_DIR: The root directory of your project (likely *vsimp4*)
# PROJ_TCL: The synthesis .tcl script for your entire pipeline
SVN_REPO="/afs/umich.edu/user/<rest of SVN repository path here>"
AFS_DIR="/afs/umich.edu/user/<rest of path here>"

EMAIL="<uniqname>@umich.edu"

# Will have to guesstimate on runtime and memory requirements
# WALLTIME: A limit on the amount of time your job will get to run
# MEM: Amount of physical memory that your job will be allocated
WALLTIME="00:10:00"
MEM="500mb"

# Note: Probably shouldn't touch these unless told to by the GSI
# QUEUE: Name of queue to submit batch job to
# PBS_FILE: Shell PBS script which will be executed when job runs
QUEUE="route"
