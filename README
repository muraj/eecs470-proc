1) a)  Run Simulation - make simv
       Run Synthesis  - make syn
       Run in Debug   - make DEBUG=1 [simv|syn]
       Run all tests against in order processor - run_tests.sh --help
            Read help for more details, requires an in-order
            processor to compare against (to compare memory,
            inorder needs to output memory to memory.out)
   b)  synth/oo_pipeline.out
       synth/oo_pipeline.rep
       synth/pipeline.vg
   c)  Final clock period is 10.2 ns
   d)  All tests in test_progs report same results as in order processor.
       Therefore all tests pass.
